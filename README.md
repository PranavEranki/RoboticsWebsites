# Website

## Instalation:
1. Download the zip
2. Delete the 7610-Website folder, as you only need the Template and images folder.
3. Look through the readme (on this page) for further instructions and things to note.

## Editing:
* To complete and customize this website, all you need is some basic HTML and CSS skills. Please ask for help if necessary.
* Comments are placed where you need to put in your custom info.
* Get images and place them in the *images* folder, and reference them in your `<a href = "..">`s
* Go through the html files in the templates folder (post-extraction) and edit them to fit your team:
  - Change up the code for yourself (colors, names of teams, etc)
  - Change the about and bios page, so you could further customize the site (documentation provided in html)
  - Please change the metadata, which is available at the top of every html file, to match your team (again, documentation in the html files)

## Want a custom domain?

If you want to host this website on a custom domain, make a new github user and upload this template as a .github.io repository. For more instructions on that, click [here](https://pages.github.com/)

## Some things to note:
* The logo onload color is white, then it becomes black as you scroll down a bit. Don't be alarmed if the number in the logo does not load immediately.
* This is meant to be as a template for all the teams to use and create a personal website.
* The website may look extremely empty - don't worry, check the html files. You need to fill stuff in
* Please contact me @*pranav.eranki@gmail.com* or talk to me during school if you have any questions.
